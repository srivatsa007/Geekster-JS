Book-app project: implemented an application that utilized APIs to fetch book information and exhibited it within a book app. 
  * I employed JavaScript to interact with the API, retrieving specific book details such as titles, authors, summaries, cover images, and possibly other relevant information.
  * This data was then displayed within your application, enabling users to browse through the books and potentially access further details or actions related to the books presented.
  * The project essentially focused on integrating external data from APIs into a user-friendly book-centric interface.

* Catagories API:
